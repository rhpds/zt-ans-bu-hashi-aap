= Trigger Infrastructure Provisioning and automation from Terraform Enterprise

In this challenge you will learn how to trigger infrastructure provisioning and automation from Terraform Enterprise.

There are a number of prerequisites that you will need to complete before you can start this lab.

* Vault Enterprise
* Terraform Enterprise
** Cloning a GitHub repository to your account
** Create a Terraform Enterprise Workspace that used Version Control System (VCS) to store the Terraform code

[#task1]
== Configure the Vault Enterprise Secret Engine

Open the Vault Enterprise UI in your browser.
In the `Method` dropdown, select `Userpass`.
Enter the following details to login to the Vault Enterprise UI.

* `User:  admin`
* `Password:  ansible123!`
* Click on the `Sign In` button.

* Click on the `Vault` menu option in the left menu.
* Click on the `Secrets Engines` menu option.
* Click on the `+ Enable new engine` button.

* Select the `KV` secrets engine from the `Generic` section.
Enter the following details:

|===
| Field | Value

| Path
| secret

| Version
| 2
|===

* Scroll down and in the `Version` dropdown, select `2`. (This is the latest version of the KV secrets engine.) Must be 2.
* Scroll down and click on the `Enable Engine` button.

=== Create a new secret for your AWS keys in this secret engine

* Select the `Create secret +` option on the right
* In the `Path for this secret` field, enter `aws_creds`
* In the `Secret data` section, enter the following details:

* Get the AWS Access Key ID and AWS Secret Access Key from the `Cloud(AWS)` tab in your lab.
|===
| Field | Value

| access_key
| <Your AWS Access Key ID>

| secret_key
| <Your AWS Secret Access Key>
|===

* Click on the `Save` button.

You have now created a new secret for your AWS keys in the Vault secret engine. You can now use these keys to authenticate against the AWS cloud account.

=== Validate that you can read the secret from the Vault secret engine

Let's validate that you can read the secret from the Vault secret engine by using the Vault CLI.

* Open the `TERMINAL` tab from your lab
* You will be at the `vscode` terminal prompt
* SSH to the `vault` server by typing `ssh rhel@vault`, type `yes` when prompted

[source,bash,role=execute]
----
ssh rhel@vault
----

* Type `yes` when prompted to continue
* Enter the password `ansible123!` when prompted
* Run the following commands to login to the Vault CLI:

[source,bash,role=execute]
----
export VAULT_ADDR=http://127.0.0.1:8200
vault login -address=http://127.0.0.1:8200 -method=userpass username=admin password=ansible123!
----

* You are now logged in to the Vault CLI.
* Run either of the following commands to read the secret from the Vault secret engine:

[source,bash,role=execute]
----
vault kv get secret/aws_creds

OR

vault kv get -mount=secret aws_creds
----

You should see the AWS Access Key ID and AWS Secret Access Key in the output.

=== Create an Application Role in Vault Enterprise (AppRole) for Terraform Enterprise

In this task we will create an Application Role in Vault Enterprise (AppRole) for Terraform Enterprise so that Terraform Enterprise can authenticate against the Vault secret engine.

Before creating the Application Role, we need to create a `Policy` that will allow the Terraform Enterprise to read the secret from the Vault secret engine.

* Back in the Vault Enterprise UI, click on the `Policies` menu option in the left menu.
* Click on the `ACL Policies` menu option in the left menu.
* Click on the `Create ACL policy +` button on the right.
* For the `Name` field, enter `terraform-policy`
* Enter the following into the `Policy` body:

[source,hcl,role=execute]
----
# Read AWS credentials
path "secret/data/aws_creds" {
  capabilities = ["read"]
}
# Write SSH keys
path "secret/data/*/ssh-keys/*" {
  capabilities = ["create", "read", "update", "delete"]
}
path "secret/data/rhel-server/ssh-keys/*" {
  capabilities = ["create", "read", "update", "delete"]
}
# Allow creating child tokens 
path "auth/token/create" {
  capabilities = ["create", "update"]
}
path "auth/token/renew-self" {
  capabilities = ["update"]
}
path "auth/token/lookup-self" {
  capabilities = ["read"]
}
----

* Click on the `Create policy` button.

You have now created a new policy for the Terraform Enterprise to read the secret from the Vault secret engine.

Now let's enable the AppRole authentication method in Vault Enterprise UI.

* Select the `Access` menu option in the left menu.
* Click on the `Authentication Methods` menu option in the left menu.
* Click on the `+ Enable new method +` button on the right.
* Click on the `AppRole` tile.

* In the `Path` field, keep it at the default of `approle`
* Click on `Eanble method` to enable the AppRole authentication method

NOTE: The Vault UI only supports the configuration of the AppRole authentication method. You will need to use the Vault CLI to create the Application Role.

* Open the `TERMINAL` tab from your lab
* You will be at the `vscode` terminal prompt
* SSH to the `vault` server by typing `ssh rhel@vault`, type `yes` when prompted

[source,bash,role=execute]
----
ssh rhel@vault
----

* Type `yes` when prompted to continue
* Enter the password `ansible123!` when prompted

* Run the following command to login to the Vault CLI (if you are not already logged in):

[source,bash,role=execute]
----
export VAULT_ADDR=http://127.0.0.1:8200
vault login -address=http://127.0.0.1:8200 -method=userpass username=admin password=ansible123!
----

* Run the following command to create the Application Role:

[source,bash,role=execute]
----
vault write auth/approle/role/terraform policies=terraform-policy
----

* You have now created an Application Role in Vault Enterprise (AppRole) for Terraform Enterprise so that Terraform Enterprise can authenticate against the Vault secret engine.
