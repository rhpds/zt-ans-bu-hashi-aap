= Trigger Infrastructure Provisioning and automation from Terraform Enterprise - Part 2

In this part we will continue the prerequisites and put the final touches on the Terraform Enterprise Workspace.

The following diagram shows the overall scenario that we started in the previous lab section.

image::module2-3scenario.png[]

Let's work through to completion of this scenario.

NOTE:  **You MUST have a github account to complete this lab.**

* Terraform Enterprise
** Import a GitHub repository to your account
** Create a Terraform Enterprise Workspace that uses Version Control System (VCS, in this case GitHub) to store the Terraform code
** Trigger Terraform infrastructure provisioning and automation by committing changes to the Terraform code in the GitHub repository.

In this challenge you will learn how to bring in HashiCorp Vault Enterprise to your automation pipeline.

[#task1]
== Import the GitHub repository to your account

NOTE: To create your own UNLINKED GitHub repository, Use the GitHub.com UI to `IMPORT REPOSITORY` from an existing repository.
The following repository contains the Terraform code for the infrastructure you will be provisioning.

* https://github.com/ansible-tmm/aap-hashi-lab-2.git  # This is the repository you will be importing to your account
* While logged in to Github.com with your acccount, the top right corner click on the `+` icon, and select `Import repository`

image::importrepo.png[]

* In the `Repository URL` field, enter the URL of the repository you want to import, in this case: https://github.com/ansible-tmm/aap-hashi-lab-2.git
* Scroll down and enter a `Repository name` for your new repository, in this case: `aap-hashi-lab-2` (or another name if you prefer)
* Click on the `Begin import` button to import the repository to your account.

Later in this lab, you will be committing changes to the Terraform code in the GitHub repository, which in turn will trigger the Terraform infrastructure provisioning and automation, and will retrieve secrets from Vault Enterprise.

[#task2]
== Set up the Terraform Enterprise Workspace

We now want to create a new Terraform Enterprise Workspace that uses *Version Control System (VCS)* to store the Terraform code. By doing this, you will be able to trigger the Terraform infrastructure provisioning and Ansible automation by committing changes to the Terraform code in the GitHub repository that you imported earlier.

Back in the Terraform Enterprise UI, click on the `Workspaces` menu option in the left menu.

* Click on the `New` button on the right, and select `Workspace` from the dropdown.
* Enter the following details:
* For the `Project` field, select `rhdp-initial-project` from the dropdown, and select `Create`

BACK in the `Terraform Enterprise UI`, please do the following:

* For the `Name` field, enter your initials, followed by dash and github, example: `jdoe-github`
* Paste the `Client ID` to the Client ID field.
* Paset the `Client Secret` to the Client Secret field.
* Click on the `Connect and Continue` button to save the VCS provider configuration

image::workspace6.png[]

* You will be redirected to GitHub.com to authorize the Terraform Enterprise application to access your GitHub account, please `authenticate and authorize`.
* Scroll to the bottom of the screen and click on the `Skip and Finish` button
* On the next screen, you will need to choose the repository you want to use for this workspace. For this lab, we will ***use the repository you imported earlier into your GitHub account**

image::workspace6-1.png[]

* The Workspace Name will default ot the repository name. Change the `Workspace Name` to `TFE-Demo-VCS`
* For the `Description` field, enter `Using GitHub commits to trigger Plan/Apply Runs`
* Expand the `Advanced Options` section, and check both of the `Auto-apply` option checkboxes. This will automatically apply the changes to the workspace when you commit changes to the repository.
* For the `Terraform Working Directory` field, enter `TF_templates/AWS/`

|===
| Field | Value

| Workspace Name
| TFE-Demo-VCS

| Description
| Using GitHub commits to trigger Plan/Apply Runs

| Terraform Working Directory
| **TF_templates/AWS/**

| Auto-apply
| Check both of the `Auto-apply` option checkboxes. This will automatically apply the changes to the workspace when you commit changes to the repository.
|===

* Scroll down the bottom of the screen and click on the `Create` button to save the workspace configuration

image::workspace7.png[]

* Scroll down the bottom of the screen and click on the `Create` button to save the workspace configuration

While you still have the GitHub UI open, navigate to the repository you cloned earlier into your GitHub account please perform the following:

* Navigate to the repository `SETTINGS` -> `WEBHOOKS`
* You will see the Terraform Enterprise webhook configuration, click on the `Edit` button
* Scroll down to the `SSL verification` section, and check the `Disable` checkbox. When prompted, click on the `I understand`
* For the `Which events would you like to trigger this webhook?` section:
** select `Just the push event.`
* Scroll down and click on the `Update Webhook` button to save the webhook configuration
* Authenticate to your GitHub account if prompted

[#task3]
== Trigger infrastructure provisioning and automation

Now we're all set to trigger the infrastructure provisioning and automation from Terraform Enterprise by committing changes to the Terraform code in the GitHub repository.

=== Perform a quick test run in the Terraform Enterprise Workspace

Let's perform a quick test to make sure we set up the Terraform Enterprise Workspace correctly.  This will be a `Plan only` run, so we will not actually create any resources.

* Click on the `+ New Run` button in the top right of the Workspace overview screen.
* Click on the `Start` button to perform a quick test run of the Terraform code in the Terraform Enterprise Workspace.

image::testplanonly2.png[]

* You will see the plan run completed successfully.

image::testplanonly3.png[]

**GREAT! We are all set to commit changes to the Terraform code in the GitHub repository to trigger the infrastructure provisioning and automation.**

=== Commit changes to the Terraform code in the GitHub repository

* Navigate to the repository you cloned earlier into your GitHub account
* Click on the `Code` tab, and go to the `TF_templates/AWS/` folder
* Select the `terraform.tfvars` file, and on the right click on the `Pencil` and select `In place`
* Chance the `instance_count = 0` to `instance_count = 2`
* Click on the `Commit changes` button to commit the changes to the repository, then click `Commit` directly to the main branch

image::gitcommit1.png[]

=== What will happen now in Terraform Enterprise

* Below you will see the plan and apply in Terraform Enterprise, and the resources that will be created.

image::planapply1.png[]

* Please observe the output of the plan and apply.

image::planapply2.png[]

=== What will happen now in Ansible Automation Platform

* Terraform Enterprise will then trigger the `WF-Launched by TFE` workflow template in Ansible Automation Platform. You will see the workflow in a `Running` state.

image::tfewf0.png[]

* After a few minutes, you will see the workflow template successfully completed.

image::tfewf1.png[]

* If you look at the job template output, you will see the Nginx installation completed successfully on all the new EC2 instances.

image::tfewf2.png[]

* The Terraform Inventory in Ansible Automation Platform will be synchronized with the new resources.
* The RHEL ec2 instances will have Nginx installed and running on them.
* Feel free to navigate to the public IP address of the EC2 instances and verify the Nginx installation.

== Summary
The following scenario is what you competed in module 2 and module 3 of this lab. 

* You learned how to trigger infrastructure provisioning and automation from Terraform Enterprise using GitHub commits.
* You also learned how to configure Ansible Automation Platform to retrieve secrets from HashiCorp Vault Enterprise. AAP retrieved the SSH private key for the RHEL ec2 instances, from Vault Enterprise, to allow Ansible to connect to the instances and install Nginx.
