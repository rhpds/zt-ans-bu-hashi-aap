You have now created a new secret for your AWS keys in the Vault secret engine. You can now use these keys to authenticate against the AWS cloud account.

=== Validate that you can read the secret from the Vault secret engine

Let's validate that you can read the secret from the Vault secret engine by using the Vault CLI.

* Open the `TERMINAL` tab from your lab
* You will be at the `vscode` terminal prompt
* SSH to the `vault` server by typing `ssh rhel@vault`, type `yes` when prompted

[source,bash,role=execute]
----
ssh rhel@vault
----

* Type `yes` when prompted to continue
* Enter the password `ansible123!` when prompted
* Run the following commands to login to the Vault CLI:

[source,bash,role=execute]
----
export VAULT_ADDR=http://127.0.0.1:8200
vault login -address=http://127.0.0.1:8200 -method=userpass username=admin password=ansible123!
----

* You are now logged in to the Vault CLI.
* Run either of the following commands to read the secret from the Vault secret engine:

[source,bash,role=execute]
----
vault kv get secret/aws_creds

OR

vault kv get -mount=secret aws_creds
----

You should see the AWS Access Key ID and AWS Secret Access Key in the output.

=== Create an Application Role in Vault Enterprise (AppRole) for Terraform Enterprise

In this task we will create an Application Role in Vault Enterprise (AppRole) for Terraform Enterprise so that Terraform Enterprise can authenticate against the Vault secret engine.

Before creating the Application Role, we need to create a `Policy` that will allow the Terraform Enterprise to read the secret from the Vault secret engine.

* Back in the Vault Enterprise UI, click on the `Policies` menu option in the left menu.
* Click on the `ACL Policies` menu option in the left menu.
* Click on the `Create ACL policy +` button on the right.
* For the `Name` field, enter `terraform-policy`
* Enter the following into the `Policy` body:

[source,hcl,role=execute]
----
# Read AWS credentials
path "secret/data/aws_creds" {
  capabilities = ["read"]
}
# Write SSH keys
path "secret/data/*/ssh-keys/*" {
  capabilities = ["create", "read", "update", "delete"]
}
path "secret/data/rhel-server/ssh-keys/*" {
  capabilities = ["create", "read", "update", "delete"]
}
# Allow creating child tokens 
path "auth/token/create" {
  capabilities = ["create", "update"]
}
path "auth/token/renew-self" {
  capabilities = ["update"]
}
path "auth/token/lookup-self" {
  capabilities = ["read"]
}
----

* Click on the `Create policy` button.

You have now created a new policy for the Terraform Enterprise to read the secret from the Vault secret engine.

Now let's enable the AppRole authentication method in Vault Enterprise UI.

* Select the `Access` menu option in the left menu.
* Click on the `Authentication Methods` menu option in the left menu.
* Click on the `+ Enable new method +` button on the right.
* Click on the `AppRole` tile.

* In the `Path` field, keep it at the default of `approle`
* Click on `Enable method` to enable the AppRole authentication method

* Open the `TERMINAL` tab from your lab
* You will be at the `vscode` terminal prompt
* SSH to the `vault` server by typing `ssh rhel@vault`, type `yes` when prompted

[source,bash,role=execute]
----
ssh rhel@vault
----

* Type `yes` when prompted to continue
* Enter the password `ansible123!` when prompted

* Run the following command to login to the Vault CLI (**if you are not already logged in**):

[source,bash,role=execute]
----
export VAULT_ADDR=http://127.0.0.1:8200
vault login -address=http://127.0.0.1:8200 -method=userpass username=admin password=ansible123!
----

* Run the following command to create the AppRole for Terraform Enterprise:

[source,bash,role=execute]
----
vault write auth/approle/role/terraform token_policies=terraform-policy
----

* Now get the Role ID and Secret ID for the AppRole for Terraform Enterprise:

[source,bash,role=execute]
----
vault read auth/approle/role/terraform/role-id

then

vault write -f auth/approle/role/terraform/secret-id
----

* Copy the Role ID and Secret ID to your clipboard. You will need these momentarily

==== Test the AppRole authentication method

Let's test the AppRole authentication method by using the Vault CLI.

[source,bash,role=execute]
----
vault write auth/approle/login \
    role_id=<terraform-role-id> \
    secret_id=<terraform-secret-id>
----

image::approle4.png[]

* You have now created an Application Role in Vault Enterprise (AppRole) for Terraform Enterprise so that Terraform Enterprise can authenticate against the Vault secret engine.

We need to repeat this process to create an AppRole for Ansible Automation Platform.

=== Create an Application Role in Vault Enterprise (AppRole) for Ansible Automation Platform

In this task we will create an Application Role in Vault Enterprise (AppRole) for Ansible Automation Platform so that Ansible Automation Platform can authenticate against the Vault secret engine.

Before creating the Application Role, we need to create a `Policy` that will allow the Ansible Automation Platform to read the secret from the Vault secret engine.

* Back in the Vault Enterprise UI, click on the `Policies` menu option in the left menu.
* Click on the `ACL Policies` menu option in the left menu.
* Click on the `Create ACL policy +` button on the right.
* For the `Name` field, enter `aap-policy`
* Enter the following into the `Policy` body:

[source,hcl,role=execute]
----
# Allow AAP to read SSH keys
path "secret/data/rhel-server/ssh-keys/*" {
  capabilities = ["read"]
}

path "secret/data/*/ssh-keys/*" {
  capabilities = ["read"]
}

# Allow AAP to write instance metadata
path "secret/data/*/metadata" {
  capabilities = ["create", "read", "update"]
}
----

* Click on the `Create policy` button.

image::aappolicy.png[]

You have now created a new policy for Ansible Automation Platform to read the secret from the Vault secret engine.

* Open the `TERMINAL` tab from your lab
* You will be at the `vscode` terminal prompt
* SSH to the `vault` server by typing `ssh rhel@vault`, type `yes` when prompted

[source,bash,role=execute]

* Type `yes` when prompted to continue
* Enter the password `ansible123!` when prompted

* Run the following command to login to the Vault CLI (**if you are not already logged in**):

[source,bash,role=execute]
----
export VAULT_ADDR=http://127.0.0.1:8200
vault login -address=http://127.0.0.1:8200 -method=userpass username=admin password=ansible123!
----

* Run the following command to create the AppRole for Ansible Automation Platform:

[source,bash,role=execute]
----
vault write auth/approle/role/aap token_policies=aap-policy
----

* Now get the Role ID and Secret ID for the AppRole for (Ansible Automation Platform):

[source,bash,role=execute]
----
vault read auth/approle/role/aap/role-id

then

vault write -f auth/approle/role/aap/secret-id
----

* Copy the Role ID and Secret ID to your clipboard. You will need these momentarily

==== Test the AppRole authentication method

Let's test the AppRole authentication method by using the Vault CLI.

[source,bash,role=execute]
----
vault write auth/approle/login \
    role_id=<aap-role-id> \
    secret_id=<aap-secret-id>
----

* You have now created an Application Role in Vault Enterprise (AppRole) for Ansible Automation Platform so that Ansible Automation Platform can authenticate against the Vault secret engine.
