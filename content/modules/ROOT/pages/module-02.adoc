There are a number of prerequisites that you will need to complete before you can start this lab.

* Vault Enterprise
* Terraform Enterprise
** Cloning a GitHub repository to your account
** Create a Terraform Enterprise Workspace that used Version Control System (VCS) to store the Terraform code

Part 1 of this lab will focus on configuring the Vault Enterprise Secret Engine.

[#task1]
== Configure the Vault Enterprise Secret Engine

Open the Vault Enterprise UI in your browser.
In the `Method` dropdown, select `Userpass`.
Enter the following details to login to the Vault Enterprise UI.

* `User:  admin`
* `Password:  ansible123!`
* Click on the `Sign In` button.

* Select the `KV` secrets engine from the `Generic` section.
Enter the following details:

|===
| Field | Value

| Path
| secret

| Version
| 2
|===

* Expand the `Method Options` section to see the available options.
* Scroll down and in the `Version` dropdown, select `2`. (This is the latest version of the KV secrets engine.) Must be 2.
* Scroll down and click on the `Enable Engine` button.

=== Create a new secret for your AWS keys in this secret engine

* Select the `Create secret +` option on the right
* In the `Path for this secret` field, enter `aws_creds`
* In the `Secret data` section, enter the following details:

* Get the AWS Access Key ID and AWS Secret Access Key from the `Cloud(AWS)` tab in your lab.
|===
| Field | Value

| access_key
| <Your AWS Access Key ID>

| secret_key
| <Your AWS Secret Access Key>
|===

* Click on the `Save` button.

image::vaultawscreds.png[]

You have now created a new secret for your AWS keys in the Vault secret engine. You can now use these keys to authenticate against the AWS cloud account.

=== Validate that you can read the secret from the Vault secret engine

Let's validate that you can **read the secret from the Vault secret engine by using the Vault CLI**.

* Open the `TERMINAL` tab from your lab
* You will be at the `vscode` terminal prompt
* SSH to the `vault` server by typing `ssh rhel@vault`, type `yes` when prompted

[source,bash,role=execute]
----
ssh rhel@vault
----

* Type `yes` when prompted to continue
* Enter the password `ansible123!` when prompted
* Run the following commands to login to the Vault CLI:

[source,bash,role=execute]
----
export VAULT_ADDR=http://127.0.0.1:8200
vault login -address=http://127.0.0.1:8200 -method=userpass username=admin password=ansible123!
----

* You are now logged in to the Vault CLI.
* Run either of the following commands to read the secret from the Vault secret engine:

[source,bash,role=execute]
----
vault kv get secret/aws_creds

OR

vault kv get -mount=secret aws_creds
----

image::vaultawscreds2.png[]

You should see the AWS Access Key ID and AWS Secret Access Key in the output.

=== Create an Application Role in Vault Enterprise (AppRole)

In this task we will create an Application Role in Vault Enterprise (AppRole) for both Terraform Enterprise and Ansible Automation Platform so that they can authenticate against the Vault secret engine to read and write secrets.

Before creating the Application Role, we need to create a `Policy` in Vault Enterprise.

NOTE: **For simplicity**, In this lab we will create a single policy for both Terraform Enterprise and Ansible Automation Platform. In a production environment, you would create a separate policy for each system.

* Back in the Vault Enterprise UI, click on the `Policies` menu option in the left menu.
* Click on the `ACL Policies` menu option in the left menu.
* Click on the `Create ACL policy +` button on the right.
* For the `Name` field, enter `aap-terraform-policy`
* Enter the following into the `Policy` body:

[source,hcl,role=execute]
----
### Read AWS credentials
path "secret/data/aws_creds" {
  capabilities = ["read"]
}
### Write SSH keys - TFE to write, and AAP to read SSH keys
path "secret/data/*/ssh-keys/*" {
  capabilities = ["create", "read", "update", "delete"]
}
path "secret/data/rhel-server/ssh-keys/*" {
  capabilities = ["create", "read", "update", "delete"]
}
# Allow creating child tokens
path "auth/token/create" {
  capabilities = ["create", "update"]
}
path "auth/token/renew-self" {
  capabilities = ["update"]
}
path "auth/token/lookup-self" {
  capabilities = ["read"]
}
#
### TFE and AAP can see, list, and read metadata
path "secret/metadata/*" {
  capabilities = ["list", "read"]
}
# Allow TFE and AAP to write instance metadata
path "secret/data/*/metadata" {
  capabilities = ["create", "read", "update", "delete"]
}
----

* Click on the `Create policy` button.

image::terraformpolicy.png[]

You have now created a new policy in Vault Enterprise.

Now let's enable the `AppRole authentication method` in Vault Enterprise UI. The AppRole authentication method in HashiCorp Vault is for machines, services, and automated applications to securely authenticate with Vault

* Return to the main menu by clicking on the `Back to main navigation` menu option in the top left.
* Select the `Access` menu option in the left menu.
* Click on the `Authentication Methods` menu option in the left menu.
* Click on the `+ Enable new method +` button on the right.
* Click on the `AppRole` tile.

image::approle1.png[]

* In the `Path` field, keep it at the default of `approle`
* Click on `Enable method` to enable the AppRole authentication method

image::approle2.png[]

NOTE: The Vault UI only supports the configuration of the AppRole authentication method. You will need to use the Vault CLI to create the Application Role, and perform additional configuration steps.

image::approle3.png[]

* Open the `TERMINAL` tab from your lab
* You will be at the `vscode` terminal prompt
* SSH to the `vault` server by typing `ssh rhel@vault`, type `yes` when prompted

[source,bash,role=execute]
----
ssh rhel@vault
----

* Type `yes` when prompted to continue
* Enter the password `ansible123!` when prompted

* Run the following command to login to the Vault CLI (**if you are not already logged in**):

[source,bash,role=execute]
----
export VAULT_ADDR=http://127.0.0.1:8200
vault login -address=http://127.0.0.1:8200 -method=userpass username=admin password=ansible123!
----

* Run the following command to create  a role named `aapterraform` within the AppRole authentication method in Vault Enterprise. It explicitly assigns the `aap-terraform-policy` to any tokens generated by this role. This is a standard step for any AppRole in Vault Enterprise.


[source,bash,role=execute]
----
vault write auth/approle/role/aapterraform token_policies=aap-terraform-policy
----

* You should see the following output: `Success! Data written to: auth/approle/role/aapterraform`
* Now get the `Role ID` and `Secret ID` for the AppRole:

[source,bash,role=execute]
----
vault read auth/approle/role/aapterraform/role-id

then

vault write -f auth/approle/role/aapterraform/secret-id
----

* **Copy the Role ID and Secret ID to your clipboard. You will need these momentarily**

==== **Test the AppRole authentication method**

Let's test the AppRole authentication method by using the Vault CLI. (using the `role_id` and `secret_id` you copied a moment ago)

[source,bash,role=execute]
----
vault write auth/approle/login \
    role_id=<aapterraform-role-id> \
    secret_id=<aapterraform-secret-id>
----

image::approle4.png[]

You have now created an Application Role (AppRole) in Vault Enterprise. Ansible Automation Platform and Terraform Enterprise can now authenticate securely against the Vault secret engine.

[#task2]
