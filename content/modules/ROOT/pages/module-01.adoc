= *Terraform Enterprise & Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform*
image::main.png[]

Welcome!!! 

Terraform (Enterprise and HCP Terraform) is a great tool you can use for deploying cloud infrastructure using delcarative Infrastructure as Code (IaC).
It allows you to define infrastructure as code and then build, modify, and destroy these resources declaratively.
Terraform (Enterprise and HCP Terraform) can be a simple way to deploy infrastructure, however if you add Ansible Automation Platform, together they can be used to automate the entire infrastructure lifecycle, from build to deploy, to manage, and to retire infrastructure, to enhance your automation journey!

Estimated time to complete: _45 minutes_

* Welcome to the `Terraform Enterprise & Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform` lab.
In the following challenge tasks you will use Ansible Automation Platform and Terraform Enterprise together.
Centrally from Ansible Automation Platform you will trigger an Ansible Workflow that will use Terraform to create cloud Infrastructure, and then synchronize the inventory back into Ansible Automation Platform, and go on to perform other configuration and orchestration tasks.

* In this first challenge you will learn
** How to create an Ansible Workflow template and run it to create resources in AWS using Terraform Enterprise and Ansible Automation Platform will perform further configuration and orchestration tasks.

There are `several prerequisites` that you will need to complete before you can start this lab. These are:

* Terraform Enterprise prerequisites
* Ansible Automation Platform prerequisites

[#task1]
== Create the Terraform Enterprise API token

This task is done in Terraform Enterprise. You will need to create an API token in Terraform Enterprise to use in Ansible Automation Platform to authenticate against Terraform Enterprise.

Login to Terraform Enterprise using the following *Login Credentials:*  

* `User:  admin`
* `Password:  ansible123!`

* Select the organization `rhdp-tf-org`.
* In the left menu, click on `Settings` to expand the organzation settings options, and then click on `API Tokens`.


To create the API token, you will need to navigate to the `Settings` menu in Terraform Enterprise.

[#task4]
== Create the Terraform Enterprise Credential in Ansible Automation Platform

Credentials are utilized for authentication when launching Jobs against machines, synchronizing with inventory sources, and importing project content from a version control system.
In this lab, we have created some different credentials.

This task is done in Ansible Automation Platform.

Log in to the `Ansible Automation Platform` 

Click on the `Ansible Automation Platform` tab at the top of lab.

Log in using the following *Login Credentials:*

* `Password:  ansible123!`

Expand the `Automation Execution` menu on the left.
`Automation Execution` -> `Infrastructure` -> `Credentials`.
Click on the `Credentials` link and examine some of pre-configured credentials

NOTE: The keys are encrypted so no one, not even an administrator, can see the keys once placed in Ansible Automation Platfrom as a credential.

. Click on `+ Create credential`
. For the `Name` enter `Terraform Enterprise credential`
. Expand the `Credential Type` drop-down, and select `Terraform Enterprise credential type`
. In the `Terraform Enterprise Hostname` section enter `<Your terraform hostname url>`
. In the `Organization` section enter `rhdp-tf-org`
. In the `Workspace` section enter `TFE-Demo`
. In the `Token` section enter the API token you generated earlier in Terraform Enterprise

* Observe the output of the Workflow Template run. You will see the nodes running and the workflow visualizer showing the flow of the workflow.

* Observice the resources that were destroyed by Terraform in Ansible Automation Platform -> Inventory -> Terraform Inventory -> Hosts.

* Observe the resource count in the Terraform Enterprise console. You will see the resource count should be 0.



=== SUMMARY
* In this lab section you created an configured AAP and Terraform Enterprise to work together.
* You created Workflow templates in Ansible Automation Platform that kick off Terraform Enterprise to provision cloud resources, and then Ansible Automation Platform performed further automation operations on the resources.
* You created a Workflow template to destroy the resources created by Terraform.

This work further enhances the **BETTER TOGETHER STORY!**, and additionally providing more options and choice for Automators and Infrastructure operators!*
